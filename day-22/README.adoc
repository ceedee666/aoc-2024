== Day 22

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* pairwise from itertools
* defaultdict from collections

=== Main idea

First part was the straight forward implementation of the rules. For the second
part I build a dict of seen patterns. I took me about ab hour to find out that
the example string between part one and two changes. I was rewriting the
program 10 times and never understood why the tests failed...

=== What did I learn

Better double check your tests not only the production code.

=== How to run

Run using: `$ python solution.py --help`
