== Day 11

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* cache from the functools module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html)

=== Main idea

For part 1 I used a simple approach to construct a list of stones. Of cause
this failed for the second part. For the second I noticed that it is possible
to check individual stones. The result does not depend on the neighbours of the
stones. Therefore I used a recursive function together with a cache. 

=== What did I learn
