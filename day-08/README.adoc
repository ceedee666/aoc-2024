== Day 08

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* `defaultdict` from collections (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)
* `chain` and `permutations` for the itertools (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)

=== Main idea

Just vector arithmetics using complex numbers. 

=== What did I learn

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python solution.py --help`
