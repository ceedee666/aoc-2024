== Day 19

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* cache functions from functools
 
=== Main idea

Implemented a recursive solution first. Ran very slowly without caching. So I
switched to a dynamic programming solution. For part two i switched back to a
recursive approach as I had no better idea. As soon as I used the cache it was
reasonably fast. 

=== What did I learn

Should try caching to improve performance before trying a different approach. 

=== How to run

Run using: `$ python solution.py --help`
