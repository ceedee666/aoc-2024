== Day 24

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

Part one is simply a simulation of the circuit. For part two I had to read
reddit and Wikipedia a lot. Turns out that if we assume the circuit is a
ripple-carry-adder
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)#Ripple-carry_adder) we can check the 
following rules and find the wrong wires:

1. If an XOR gate has x and y-wires as input, the output cannot be a z-wire.
2. The output of all other XOR gates must be a z-wire.
3. All AND gates must be connected to OR gates.
4. The output of an XOR gate cannot be connected to an OR gate.


=== What did I learn

I have to read up on basic logic circuits again!

=== How to run

Run using: `$ python solution.py --help`
