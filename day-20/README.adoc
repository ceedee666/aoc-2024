== Day 20

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* combinations from itertools
* heapq 

=== Main idea

Brute force for part 1. Simply created all possible mazes and calculated the
path lenght. Obviously this is not working for part 2.

For part 2 I calculated the manhatten distance for all possible pairs on the
path. If the initial distance is lager then the manhatten distance we found a
cheat.

=== What did I learn


=== How to run

Run using: `$ python solution.py --help`
