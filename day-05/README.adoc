== Day 05

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* partial, cmp_to_key from functools

=== Main idea

After solving it using some custom logic I got the idea of using `sorted` using
a custom key function. With this approach the sollution for both parts is
basically a one liner.

=== What did I learn

I learned about the custom key function for `sorted`, again...

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_05.py --help`
