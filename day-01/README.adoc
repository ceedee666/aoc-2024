== Day 01

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* Counter from collections

=== Main idea

Nothing special today. Just parse the input file and split the two lists. For
the second part the Counter is very useful.

=== What did I learn

I learnd how the `*` can be used to unzip lists
(https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip).

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_01.py --help`
