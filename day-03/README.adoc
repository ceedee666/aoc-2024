== Day 03

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea for part one was to use regex to find the multiplications and to
use `eval` to execute them. 

For the second I removed everything between `don't()` and `do()` from the
input. However, first solution did not work. I used a greedy regex
`don't\(\).*do\(\)`. But this disabled to much of the multiplications. Had to
change the regex to `don't\(\).*do\(\)` to get the correct solution.

=== What did I learn


Greedy vs. Non-Greedy Matching in regex.
=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python solution.py --help`
