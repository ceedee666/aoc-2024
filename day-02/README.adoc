== Day 02

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

Again a quite straight forward puzzel. I simply check if the difference in the
reportsis stricktly increasing or decreasing. For the second part I simply
generated all report variants. 

=== What did I learn

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python solution.py --help`
