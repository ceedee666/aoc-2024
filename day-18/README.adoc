== Day 17

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* heapq 
 
=== Main idea

Nice simple puzzle today. Fist part can be solved by using Dijkstra algorithm.
for the second part I simply increased the numebr of corruped bytes by one and
  re-ran the first part. Quite slow (about 10s) but worked on the first try.

=== What did I learn


=== How to run

Run using: `$ python solution.py --help`
