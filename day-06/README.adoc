== Day 06

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

The main idea is to represent positions and directiosn using complex numbers.
The grid is a simple dict. To check for loops I use sets. 

=== What did I learn

One needs to be careful with this approach when checking for loops. I initially
missed to add the psositions after turing the guard to the set of visited
positions.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_06.py --help`
