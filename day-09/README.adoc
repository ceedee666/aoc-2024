== Day 09

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

I first started working with strings. That worked for the example but not for
the real input. The reason ist the e.g. 10 has two characters. After realizing
this is switched to using a list of ints. 

For part 2 I switched to a tuple for representing the blocks. 

=== What did I learn

Numbers can have multiples characters ðŸ¤¦.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python solution.py --help`
