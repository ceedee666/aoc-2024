== Day 17

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* defaultdict form the collections module
* re for regular expressions 

=== Main idea

First part was a straight forward implementation of the different operations.

For the second part I needed to check reddit to get an idea. Afterwards I
implemented a solution that created the correct input step by step. The
important idea is that 3 bits of register A are responsible for the one value
in the output. 

=== What did I learn


=== How to run

Run using: `$ python solution.py --help`
