== Day 15

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* re (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

=== Main idea

The first part again was easy. I simply represented the coordinates as complex
numbers and executed the movements. This did not work for the second part. So I
refactored my solution to solve the movements recursively. First I check in
`can_move` if a grid element can be moved. If it is possible I execute the move
in the `move` function.

=== What did I learn

Recursion can be hard. Implementing a visualization helped me to solve all my
stupid little bugs.

=== How to run

Run using: `$ python solution.py --help`
