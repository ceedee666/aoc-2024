== Day 16

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* defaultdict form the collections module
* heapq 

=== Main idea

First part was a straight forward implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm). I really struggled with
part 2. Finally made it work....

=== What did I learn


=== How to run

Run using: `$ python solution.py --help`
