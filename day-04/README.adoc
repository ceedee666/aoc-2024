== Day 04

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

Just brute force with building possible indices of the letters of the words.
Furthermore, `defaultdict` is used to handle edge cases, i.e. indices outside
the grid.

For the second part I started in the middle of an "MAS cross" (i.e. the A) and
just checked if it is surrounded by exactly 2 MAS.

I'm very happt that I didn't try to use regex today. An approach using regex
would probably not have worked for part 2.

=== What did I learn

Copy and past is bad....

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python solution.py --help`
