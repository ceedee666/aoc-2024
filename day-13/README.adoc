== Day 13

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* re (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

=== Main idea

Solved the first part by just trying all possible combinations. Of cause, as
expected, that fails for part two. For part two I solved the equations for the
number of button presses (`na` and `nb`).

=== What did I learn

=== How to run

Run using: `$ python solution.py --help`
