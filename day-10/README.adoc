== Day 10

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* deque (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque)

=== Main idea

Straightforward BFS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search). Happy
that I immediatly rememberd using the deque from last years. My bug in the
first implementation for part 1 turned out to be the solution for part 2.

=== What did I learn

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python solution.py --help`
