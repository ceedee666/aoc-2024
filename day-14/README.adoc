== Day 14

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* re (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

=== Main idea

The first part is easy. Simply add the velocity 1000 times an calculate the
modul of the hight or width respectively. For the second part I performed
single steps and checkt when the robots all where at individual positions.

=== What did I learn

=== How to run

Run using: `$ python solution.py --help`
